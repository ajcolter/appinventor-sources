SWFUpload Javascript/Flash Libraries
If necessary, the GWT Uploader component will automatically include the SWFUpload JavaScript and Flash libraries in your page. These libraries were developed by and available from SWFUpload.org. A version is included in our distribution for convenience, but you should verify their licensing if you select to use a newer or different version from them directly.

The version of their library (v2.2.0.1) that is included in our project is licensed under The MIT License as documented in their JavaScript source code.
