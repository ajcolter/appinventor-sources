/**
 * Provides access to the raw information provided by the Uploader when an 'swfUploadLoaded' event occurs.
 * This class should not be instantiated directly, but instead you should create a {@link SWFUploadLoadedHandler} and
 * register it via the {@link org.moxieapps.gwt.uploader.client.Uploader#setSWFUploadLoadedHandler(SWFUploadLoadedHandler)}
 * <p/>
 * Note that the 'swfUploadLoaded' event is fired by the Uploader component's internal 'flashReady'
 * event to let you know that it is safe to call Uploader methods.  Also note that these events
 * are currently only fired when the Uploader component determines that the browser does not support
 * the Ajax upload technique and is therefore utilizing the SWFUpload/Flash technique for handling
 * the upload.  If you need to determine which state the Uploader component is in, you can
 * make use of the {@link org.moxieapps.gwt.uploader.client.Uploader#isAjaxUploadWithProgressEventsSupported()}
 * method.
 * <p/>
