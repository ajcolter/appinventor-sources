package org.moxieapps.gwt.uploader.client.events;

/**
 * An interface that can be used as a callback handler when uploader progress events are fired by
 * the Uploader component.  General usage is as follows:
 * <code><pre>
 * uploader.setUploadProgressHandler(new UploadProgressHandler() {
 *    public boolean onUploadProgress(UploadProgressEvent event) {
 *       Window.alert("Uploader progressed to " + event.getBytesTotal() + " bytes");
 *       return true;
 *    }
 * });
 * </pre></code>
 * <p/>
 * Note that the 'uploadProgress' event is fired periodically by the Flash Control. This event is useful for
 * providing UI updates on the page.
 * <p/>
 * Note: The Linux Flash Player fires a single uploadProgress event after the entire file has been uploaded.
 * This is a bug in the Linux Flash Player that we cannot work around.
 * <p/>
 * See the documentation on the {@link UploadProgressEvent} class for more details on the data
 * available when a progress event occurs.
