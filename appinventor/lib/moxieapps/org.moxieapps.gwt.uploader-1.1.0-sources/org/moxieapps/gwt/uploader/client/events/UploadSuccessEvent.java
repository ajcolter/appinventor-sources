/**
 * Provides access to the raw information provided by Uploader when an 'uploader success' event occurs.
 * This class should not be instantiated directly, but instead you should create a {@link UploadSuccessHandler} and
 * register it via the {@link org.moxieapps.gwt.uploader.client.Uploader#setUploadSuccessHandler(UploadSuccessHandler)}
 * method in order to access uploader success events.
 * <p/>
 * Note that 'uploadSuccess' is fired when the entire uploader has been transmitted and the server
 * returns a HTTP 200 status code. Any data outputted by the server is available in the server data property.
 * <p/>
 * Due to some bugs in the Flash Player the server response may not be acknowledged and no uploadSuccess
 * event is fired by Flash. In this case the {@link org.moxieapps.gwt.uploader.client.Uploader#setAssumeSuccessTimeout(long)}
 * setting is checked to see if enough time has passed to fire uploadSuccess anyway. In this
 * case the received response parameter will be false.
 * <p/>
 * The {@link org.moxieapps.gwt.uploader.client.Uploader#setHttpSuccess(long...)} setting allows
 * uploadSuccess to be fired for HTTP status codes other than 200. In this case no server data is
 * available from the Flash Player.
 * <p/>
 * At this point the uploader is not yet complete. Another uploader cannot be started from uploadSuccess.
