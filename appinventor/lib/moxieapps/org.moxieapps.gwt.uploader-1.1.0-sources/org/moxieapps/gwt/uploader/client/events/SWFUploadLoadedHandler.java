package org.moxieapps.gwt.uploader.client.events;

/**
 * An interface that can be used as a callback handler when SWFUpload loaded events are fired by
 * the Uploader component.  General usage is as follows:
 * <code><pre>
 * uploader.setSWFUploadLoadedHandler(new SWFUploadLoadedHandler() {
 *    public boolean onSWFUploadLoaded(SWFUploadLoadedEvent event) {
 *       Window.alert("Uploader is ready to go");
 *       return true;
 *    }
 * });
 * </pre></code>
 * Note that the 'swfUploadLoaded' event is fired by the Uploader component's internal 'flashReady'
 * event to let you know that it is safe to call Uploader methods.  Also note that these events
 * are currently only fired when the Uploader component determines that the browser does not support
 * the Ajax upload technique and is therefore utilizing the SWFUpload/Flash technique for handling
 * the upload.  If you need to determine which state the Uploader component is in, you can
 * make use of the {@link org.moxieapps.gwt.uploader.client.Uploader#isAjaxUploadWithProgressEventsSupported()}
 * method.
 * <p/>
 * See the documentation on the {@link SWFUploadLoadedEvent} class for more details on the data
 * available when an Uploader loaded event occurs.
